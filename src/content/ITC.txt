1. It is a very stable stock

2. Even though a major portion of their revenue and profits come from the sale of tobacco products, there is an upward trend in their revenue from FMCG goods. 

At the moment, only about 2% of their profit comes from FMCG, however, I feel that it is only bound to increase in the near future, once they start achieving economies of scale and increasing efficiency. 

3. Since ITC is focusing on diversifying from Cigarettes to FMCG goods, sales is guaranteed even during highly uncertain times (like another pandemic), because whatever happens, people need to eat. This makes FMCG highly inelastic, which is a good thing for investors as sales is guaranteed.

4. Apart from all this, the cherry on the cake is that ITC pays regular dividends of about 5%. 

This means that you can realise gains even without selling the stock (That is, until the share price starts falling, and I don't think it will happen anytime soon).

Now, the question is
